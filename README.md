## About the site

This site is my corner of the internet. I use it to experiment and document my front-end adventures.

The site has been redesigned and rebuilt many times. Its current tech stack uses GatsbyJS, Redux, Socket.IO, Tailwind & Firebase. All UX design and code was completed by me with a little inspiration. You can read about how parts of the site were created by [reading my articles](https://sld.codes/articles).

This site features photography by [@thepaulbalaji](https://twitter.com/thepaulbalaji) and 3D illustrations by [@allsortscreativeuk](https://www.instagram.com/allsortscreativeuk/).

### Inspiration
This site contains many ideas inspired by some awesome developers and designers, I encourage you to check out their work: @joshwcomeau, @mxbck, @yannispanagis, @celikkoseoglu, @jxnblk, @duncanbain, @wesbos, @jlengstorf, @ryangregorydev

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Can I use this site's code?

Yes, you can fork this repo. Please give me proper credit by linking back to [sld.codes](https://sld.codes).

I want to keep this site open source however it's always disheartening to find that someone has copied my work without giving me credit. I spent a non-trivial amount of effort building and designing sld.codes, and I am proud of it! *All I ask of you is to not claim this effort as your own.*

I own the images used within the hero section of this site that are referenced in the code. Please do not use without my express permission.

### Can you help me get started?

If you have questions about implementation, please refer to the this page and the [Gatsby docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/). I have spent considerable time ensuring that there are comments throughout the code to help you get started. Due to the amount of requests I receive, I cannot help individuals but may answer the odd question on twitter.

### What is the best way to credit you?

Please give me proper credit by linking back to sld.codes.

When you’re browsing BBC news, or streaming your favourite Youtube videos, I doubt you’re thinking about the site’s accessibility. We all frequent the same sites but are they setting good standards of accessibility and performance? Does a site’s popularity correlate with these standards? Let’s find out 💪.

I decided to audit 100 pages per site. This would be a good amount of data to give each site an average. As I’m sure you’ll agree, assessing 10,000 pages manually would be far too time consuming. Luckily, with a little automation and the power of lighthouse we can audit them all with a click of a button instead.

**Not interested in the code?** [Check out the results here](https://top100audits.sld.codes/).

**Disclaimer:** This was a fun experiment. Results here are by no means a complete or comprehensive assessment of the audited sites. All views expressed in this article are my own and do not represent the opinions of any entity with which I have been, am now or will be affiliated with.

### How I Audited 10,000 Web Pages

#### Puppeteer

One of my favourite npm packages that I have discovered in the last year is [puppeteer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer). Puppeteer is a Node library that provides an API to control chrome over the dev tools protocol. It can run headless (in the background), so you don’t even see it working away.

```
this.browser = await puppeteer.launch();  
this.page = await this.browser.newPage();  
await this.page.goto("[http://sld.codes/](http://sld.codes/)");  
await this.page.screenshot({path: `screenshot.png`, fullPage: true});
```

A super simple example of the power of this tool can be seen above. By running this snippet, a chromium instance will open in the background, navigate to [my personal website](http://sld.codes), and take a full page screenshot of the page.

#### Clustering

You can also run a [cluster of puppets](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer-cluster)! This allows you to tackle larger problems asynchronously with multiple instances of puppeteer workers. A simple example of how this works can be found in the readme:
```
const { Cluster } = require('puppeteer-cluster');  
   
(async () => {  
  const cluster = await Cluster.launch({  
    concurrency: Cluster.CONCURRENCY_CONTEXT,  
    maxConcurrency: 2,  
  });  
   
  await cluster.task(async ({ page, data: url }) => {  
    await page.goto(url);  
    const screen = await page.screenshot();  
  });  
   
  cluster.queue('[http://www.google.com/'](http://www.google.com/'));  
  cluster.queue('[http://www.wikipedia.org/'](http://www.wikipedia.org/'));  
   
  await cluster.idle();  
  await cluster.close();  
})();
```

#### Lighthouse

There is no better tool out there for automated auditing. Most people are familiar with its integration into the chrome dev tools but you can also run it using a [node CLI](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse#using-the-node-cli). All I needed to do to get it going was to point it to the puppeteer instance.
```
var { lhr } = await lighthouse(this.page.url(), {  
      port: new URL(this.browser.wsEndpoint()).port,  
      output: "json",  
      quiet: true,  
});
```
#### Sourcing the top 100

You can define the top 100 sites in lots of different ways. For this experiment, I settled on **Top 100 most visited by search traffic**. I sourced the list [here](https://ahrefs.com/blog/most-visited-websites/). With a little regex and a few multi cursors, I got the table on the page into JSON. I could then feed it to the cluster.

#### The Script

The web-crawler I created was fairly basic. Upon landing on a webpage, it would look through and search for any `<a>` tags and add the hrefs to a first-in first-out queue. I used a set to hold visited urls to ensure I didn’t audit the same page twice.
```
let newHrefs = await page.$$eval("a", as => as.map(a => a.href));  
        newHrefs = newHrefs.map(url => url.replace(//$/, ""));  
        newHrefs = newHrefs.filter(  
          url =>  
            !toVisit.includes(url) &&  
            !visited.has(url) &&  
            psl.get(extractHostname(url)) === hostName  
        );
```
> It turns out sites don’t always use `<a>` tags. This sometimes meant that my crawler would finish for any given site before reaching 100 pages. I didn’t notice this was the case until the audits had finished. If I were to run this experiment again I would make sure to improve the crawlers ability to search sites.

*To audit all 10,000 pages, took 21 hours and 32 minutes.*

That sounds like a crazy long time, but it works out to 7.74 seconds per audit. It should be noted that my internet is no where near fibre optic speeds and I am pretty sure that my provider throttled my connection. But, I don’t think this subtracts anything from the results when most of the world is still using 3G.

### Visualising The Information

Time to turn 10,000 JSON files into something useful 😅.

#### Parsing 1.83gb of Audit Data

I ended up with 1.83gb of audit data in JSON. I have been using JSON in react and Gatsby projects for years but never have I had to import JSON of this magnitude. It was a headache. First thing I tried to do was increase the memory that node had available. Turns out I couldn’t give it enough.

It suddenly occurred to me that while these reports contained some really useful information, they also contained 3000 lines that I was not interested in. I decided to write a script that would prune the data down to the fields in the JSON that I really needed.

This reduced 1.83gb down to 50.9mb. Much more manageable!

#### Gatsby + GraphQL

I used the [gatsby-transformer-json](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-transformer-json) package to pull all the JSON into my Gatsby project. Then used this query to source the data:
```
{  
    allAllJson {  
      edges {  
        node {  
          categories {  
            accessibility {  
              score  
            }  
            performance {  
              score  
            }  
            best_practices {  
              score  
            }  
            seo {  
              score  
            }  
          }  
          id  
          requestedUrl  
        }  
      }  
    }  
  }
  ```

Build was a little slow, but it worked!

#### Visualisations

I used the [recharts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/recharts) library, to create scatter graphs, showing the correlations. I was worried that it would not be able to handle soo many data points but I was wrong. Recharts smashed it 💪.

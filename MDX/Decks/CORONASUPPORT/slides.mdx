# Using GatsbyJS to Help My Mutual Aid Network
Building a rapid-response system for volunteers in my area with real-time alerts.

---

<p class="legal">A month ago, I came home to find this note taped to my front door:</p>


![TheLetter](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*0TFj_Zbo6Yns6obRHyIqhg.jpeg)

---

I thought this was an awesome idea 🚀
<p class="legal">(I wasn't the only one!)</p>

---

![Zoom](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*FGN01i-CHXmikoRx1_3Ykw.jpeg)

<p class="legal">The zoom call 🤙</p>

---

<p class="legal">We defined our scope of help as:</p>

We are volunteering to help each other as a community. As such, of course this is completely free. We are offering help with errands such as picking up urgent supplies, shopping, posting mail, dog walking or just friendly phone call.


---

## But theres a problem 🤔

---

## WhatsApp isn't made for admin.

---

# 🙋‍♂️
*"Let me build a site where people can submit requests for help and volunteers can claim them. That way we won't lose any."*

---

## Volunteer first and work out how after

<p class="legal">I had no idea how I was going to build what I just signed up for.</p>

---

# 💼

Can I take some time to work on this?

---

# 🎉

You sure can!

---

My Plan

- One day to get something live.
- Five days to complete the project.

---

"Don't reinvent the wheel, especially when you don't have any time to waste."

## I reused a lot of old code

- The site was built using one of my [GatsbyJS boilerplates](/boilerplates).
- Styles were taken from my [personal site](/).
- Animations were stolen from a [hackathon project](/projects/beat-street).

---

# MVP 👑

- A landing page
- Resource links
- Volunteer guidelines
- A way for those in need to create requests.
- A way for authorised volunteers to claim these requests and mark them as resolved.

Static Pages => React components in /pages

```
                                                       
        /src

index.js

```

# Pages relying on authentication

---


I'm no back-end dev

---

# 🔥

## Firebase to the rescue

- Drop-in auth module
- Realtime Database

---

Theres a plugin for that.

```

{
      resolve: "gatsby-plugin-firebase",
      options: {
        credentials: {
          apiKey: process.env.FIREBASE_API_KEY,
          authDomain: process.env.FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN,
          databaseURL: process.env.FIREBASE_DB_URL,
          projectId: process.env.FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID,
          storageBucket: process.env.FIREBASE_SB,
          messagingSenderId: process.env.FIREBASE_MSG_SENDER_ID,
          appId: process.env.FIREBASE_APP_ID
        }
      }
    },

```

---

Use firebase logic like you would any react project

```
import React from "react"
import firebase from "gatsby-plugin-firebase"                 

function Component() {
  const [data, setData] = React.useState(null)

  React.useEffect(() => {
    firebase
      .database()
      .ref("/data")
      .once("value")
      .then(snapshot => {
        setData(snapshot.val())
      })
  }, [])

  return <div>{data ? data : "Loading..."}</div>
}

export default Component
```

---

### useAuth()

```

const App = () => {
const { initialising, user } = useAuth();
if (initialising) {
    return /* Content to show while loading */;
} else {
    return /* Content to show when we have the user profile. 
            At this point if user is undefined we know the user is not logged in. */
}};

export default App;

```

 function submitRequest() {
    let payload = user
       {
          address: user.address,
          latlng: user.latLng,
          phone_number: user.phone_number,
          ...requestData,
          time: parseInt((new Date().getTime() / 1000).toFixed(0)),
       }
    firebase
      .firestore()
      .collection("cases")
      .add(payload)
      .then(() => {
        sendText(data.name);
      });
  }

Twilio Text Requests

```
const accountSid = process.env.ACCOUNTSID;
const authToken = process.env.AUTHTOKEN;
const client = require("twilio")(accountSid, authToken);

... 

app.post("/send", (req, res) => {
  const name = req.body.name;
  const message = `Hi Volunteer! We've recieved a new request from ${name}. 
                   Head to https://coronasupport.house/volunteers to claim it.`;
  volunteerPhoneNumbers.forEach(number => {
    client.messages.create({
      body: message,
      from: "+441173253685",
      to: number
    });
  });
  res.send("OK");
});
```

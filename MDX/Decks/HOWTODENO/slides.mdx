# What is Deno?

---

### A secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript.

---

### Solves the same problems as NodeJS and was made by the same guy.

---

### "(node) could have been much nicer"

*- Ryan Dahl*


---

### Uses the [V8 JavaScript engine](https://github.com/v8/v8).
(Like node!)

---

### Runtime implemented in Rust and Typescript.

---

### Just hit release candidate 1.0.0

(early adoption)

---

### Deno is ***secure by default***

---

You as the developer need to give permissions to perform certain actions in the runtime. 

### *Prevents security holes.*

---
Example main.ts:
```
// Print the current working directory
console.log( Deno.cwd() )
```
Can be run with:

```
// Explicit permission from dev to allow deno to read files.
deno run --allow-read main.ts
```

---

Supports top level await:
```
const res = await fetch('https://sld.codes')
// no async function needed!
```

---
Browser compatible events:
```
window.onload = e=> console.log("Yo!")
```
---

You can also execute Web Assembly Binaries

---

No more NPM 

---

Remote modules referenced by their URL:
```
import { serve } from "https://deno.land/std@v0.42.0/http/server.ts";
```

---
When script is run for the first time it will download and cache imports.

No package.json and code can be referenced from any URL.

---

### Main Advantages:

- Secure by default
- Browser compatible APIs.
- Test runner, file watcher and bundler baked in.
- No node modules, package.json instead reference URL.

---

# Getting Started

---

### Get Deno

Shell: 

```
curl -fsSL https://deno.land/x/install/install.sh | sh
```

PowerShell: 

```
iwr https://deno.land/x/install/install.ps1 -useb | iex

const s = serve({ port: 8000 });
console.log("http://localhost:8000/");
for await (const req of s) {
  req.respond({ body: "Hello World" });
}

```

```
